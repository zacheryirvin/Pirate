# Pirate: A Reinforcement Learning Maze Solver

This project demonstrates the application of **reinforcement learning** to develop an intelligent agent, a "pirate," capable of navigating a maze and locating hidden treasure. Through an iterative training process, the agent refines its movement and decision-making to identify the most efficient path to its objective.

## Project Methodology

The project leverages **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, a technique that combines Q-learning with neural networks within a grid-based environment. The system learns by observing its current state, executing actions, and receiving rewards as feedback, continuously improving its strategy.

## Accomplishments

### Provided Codebase
The foundational project structure included:
- A `TreasureMaze` class, which defines the maze environment, its grid, cells, and the treasure's location.  
- Auxiliary files for environment visualization and resetting functionalities.  
- Initial code for the Q-learning model architecture and basic training logic.

### My Contributions
My work focused on developing and enhancing the following:
- The **Deep Q-Learning algorithm**, incorporating essential components such as memory replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and neural network updates.  
- Functions for **training (`qtrain`)** and **playing (`play_game`)** to evaluate the model's learning progress and performance.  
- Debugging mechanisms for tracking visited cells, rewards, and terminal conditions to ensure accurate maze traversal.  
- Visual modifications to display the results after each training phase, confirming the pirate's successful progress toward the treasure.

## Connecting Learning to Computer Science Principles

### The Role and Impact of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists play a critical role in designing and implementing solutions to complex real-world problems through the use of algorithms, data structures, and intelligent systems. Their contributions are fundamental across various fields, including **medical diagnostics**, **financial forecasting**, **AI-driven robotics**, and **automation**.  
This project exemplifies a core aspect of computer science: enabling machines to learn from experience and adapt, mimicking human cognitive processes. Such innovation drives advancements across industries by creating autonomous systems that can reason, learn, and improve.

### My Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist
My methodical approach to problem-solving as a computer scientist involves:

1. **Problem Definition:** Clearly understanding the objectives, constraints, and success criteria.  
2. **System Modeling:** Representing the environment computationally, as demonstrated by the maze grid.  
3. **Algorithm Design:** Selecting an appropriate algorithmic or learning methodology.  
4. **Iteration and Testing:** Implementing, evaluating, and refining the solution based on feedback.  

For this project, I framed the pirate's journey as a **sequential decision-making problem**, breaking it down into distinct states, actions, and rewards. This systematic method reflects how computer scientists tackle challenges in both AI and software engineering.

### Ethical Responsibilities to Users and Organizations
Ethical considerations are paramount in computer science. As a developer, my responsibilities include:

- **Protecting User Privacy and Data:** Ensuring algorithms do not expose or misuse personal information.  
- **Maintaining Transparency:** Allowing users to understand how systems make decisions.  
- **Avoiding Bias:** Designing fair and inclusive models.  
- **Promoting Reliability and Safety:** Preventing harm due to software errors or misuse.  

In the context of AI projects like this, ethical practice involves carefully considering how reinforcement learning systems might be applied in real-world scenarios, ensuring alignment with societal values and organizational integrity.
